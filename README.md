The idea for this came from CS241, when we built a MIPS compiler and an article I read on how to make a basic VM in c. The end goal for this is to make a VM for Mips that is robust enough to run itself. 
In the end I want to be able to use my CS241 MIPS Compiler to be able to compile this VM and then run it in itself.

This is a terrible idea
